Associative array.
This took me a while to figure out. Make sure you have a comma between key-value pairs.
<?php 
$tifl = array("first" =>"green" , "second" =>"blue" , "third"=>"purple");
echo ($tifl["first"]);
?>


There is a difference between writing an array (use curly brackets) and accessing a specific array index (use square brackets).
$nen = array("blue", "Green", "yello");
echo $nen[2];
